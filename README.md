### Hi, I'm Ivan 👋

Having worked as a Developer for the last 22 years, I am now excited to topics such as Compilers, Data Science and Open Science. During these years, I had the opportunity to develop in multiple programming languages, such as Python, C++, Javascript, PHP, VB, JAVA, ShellScript for back-end, front-end, besides promoting DevOps and packaging. I had the chance to contribute to a few scientific projects as in Research Software Engineering (RSE) for Transportation Engineering and Public Health.

Additionally, I contributed to open source projects such as PyTorch, ibis-framework, and the Jupyter ecosystem. Recently, I have used technologies, libraries, and tools such as ibis-framework, pandas, Apache Arrow, PostgreSQL, OmniSciDB, MySQL, MSSQL, Django, Django-rest framework, fastapi, flask, Vue.js, JQuery, conda/conda-constructor, Docker, Argo Workflow, Apache Superset, and others.

As an Open Science enthusiast, I have contributed to pyOpenSci as a package reviewer and review editor and also contributed to a community for Open Science (Open Science Labs) focused on the Latin American region.

- 🌱 I’m currently working on the ArxLang, a compiler that aims to have Apache Arrow datatype as native datatypes.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on compiler projects

Some projects that I've been working recently:


## [ArtBox](https://osl-incubator.github.io/artbox/)

ArtBox is a tool set for handling multimedia files with a bunch of useful
functions.

---

## [ArxLang](https://arxlang.github.io/)

ArxLang Project is compounded mainly by three sub-projects: ASTx, IRx, and Arx.

ASTx is an agnostic expression structure for AST. It is agnostic because it is
not specific to any language, neither to the ArxLang project, although its main
focus is to provide all needed feature for ArxLang.

IRx aims to provide a translator to LLVM-IR from ASTx objects.

Arx is a new programming language that uses the power of LLVM to provide a
multi-architecture machine target code generation.

---

## [Envers](https://osl-incubator.github.io/envers/)

Envers is a command-line tool (CLI) designed to manage and version environment
variables for different deployment stages such as staging, development, and
production. It provides a secure and organized way to handle
environment-specific configurations.

---

## [fqlearn](https://osl-pocs.github.io/fqlearn/)

This Project aims to facilitate the teaching of unit operations and
thermodynamics.

---

## [Makim](https://osl-incubator.github.io/makim/)

Makim (or makim) is based on make and focus on improve the way to define targets
and dependencies. Instead of using the Makefile format, it uses yaml format.

---

## [noWorkflow](https://gems-uff.github.io/noworkflow/)

The noWorkflow project aims at allowing scientists to benefit from provenance
data analysis even when they don't use a workflow system. It transparently
collects provenance from Python scripts and notebooks and provide tools to
support the analysis and management of the provenance.

---

## [PyDataStructs](https://pydatastructs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

PyDataStructs project aims to be a Python package for various data structures
and algorithms (including their parallel implementations).

---

## [SciCookie](https://osl-incubator.github.io/scicookie)

SciCookie is a template developed by <https://opensciencelabs.org/> that creates
projects from project templates.

---

## [Sugar](https://osl-incubator.github.io/sugar/)

Sugar aims to organize your stack of containers, gathering some useful scripts
and keeping this information centralized in a configuration file. So the command
line would be very simple.
